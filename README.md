# anyline.vim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tweekmonster/anyline.vim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tweekmonster/anyline.vim)

The most customizable statusline plugin that has ever existed for Vim!

## Another statusline plugin?

As you may know, there are several statusline plugins.  However, they are way
too complicated.  Have you read the docs for any of them?  You might as well be
reading **actual books**!  *Gross!*
